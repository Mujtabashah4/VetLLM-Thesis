    Volume = {90},

    Abstract = {Wavelets have proven to be powerful bases for use in numericalanalysis and signal processing. Their power lies in the fact thatthey only require a small number of coefficients to represent gen-eral functions and large data sets accurately. This allows compres-sion and efficient computations. Classical constructions have beenlimited to simple domains such as intervals and rectangles. In thispaper we present a wavelet construction for scalar functions definedon the sphere. We show how biorthogonal wavelets with customproperties can be constructed with the lifting scheme. The basesare extremely easy to implement and allow fully adaptive subdivi-sions. We give examples of functions defined on the sphere, suchas topographic data, bidirectional reflection distribution functions,and illumination, and show how they can be efficiently representedwith spherical wavelets.},

    Volume = {61},
    Year = {1995},
    Abstract = {This paper presents procedures for the explicit parametric representation and global description of surfaces of simply connected 3-D objects. The novel techniques overcome severe limitations of earlier methods (restriction to star-shaped objects (D. H. Ballard and Ch. M. Brown, Computer Vision, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1981), constraints on positioning and shape of cross-sections (F. Solina and R. Bajcsy, IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Much. Intell. 12(2), 1990, 131-147; L. H. Staib and J. S. Duncan, in Visualization in Biomedical Computing 1992 (R. A. Robb, Ed.), Vol. Proc. SPIE 108, pp. 90-104, 1992), and nonhomogeneous distribution of parameter space). We parametrize the surface by defining a continuous, one-to-one mapping from the surface of the original object to the surface of a unit sphere. The parametrization is formulated as a constrained optimization problem. Practicable starting values are obtained by an initial mapping based on a heat conduction model. The parametrization enables us to expand the object surface into a series of spherical harmonic functions, extending to 3-D the concept of elliptical Fourier descriptors for 2-D closed curves (E. Persoon and K. S. Fu, IEEE Trans. Syst. Man Cybernetics 7(3), 1977, 388-397; F. P. Kuhl and Ch. R. Giardina, Comput. Graphics Image Process. 18(3), 1982, 236-258). Invariant, object-centered descriptors are obtained by rotating the parameter net and the object into standard positions. The new methods are illustrated with 3-D test objects. Potential applications are recognition, classification, and comparison of convoluted surfaces or parts of surfaces of 3-D shapes.}}

    Abstract = {Spherical microphone arrays have been recently studied for sound analysis and sound recordings, which have the advantage of spherical symmetry facilitating three-dimensional analysis. This paper complements the recent microphone array design studies by presenting a theoretical analysis of plane-wave decomposition given the sound pressure on a sphere. The analysis uses the spherical Fourier transform and the spherical convolution, where it is shown that the amplitudes of the incident plane waves can be calculated as a spherical convolution between the pressure on the sphere and another function which depends on frequency and the sphere radius. The spatial resolution of plane-wave decomposition given limited bandwidth in the spherical Fourier domain is formulated, and ways to improve the computation efficiency of plane-wave decomposition are introduced. The paper concludes with a simulation example of plane-wave decomposition.}}

    Abstract = {We compute the angular power spectrum C_l from the BATSE 3B catalog of 1122 gamma-ray bursts, and find no evidence for clustering on any scale. These constraints bridge the entire range from small scales (which probe source clustering and burst repetition) to the largest scales (which constrain possible anisotropies from the Galactic halo or from nearby cosmological large scale structures). We develop an analysis technique that takes the angular position errors into account, which enables us to place tight upper limits on the clustering down to scales l\approx 60, corresponding to a few degrees on the sky. The minimum-variance burst weighting that we employ is graphically visualized as an all-sky map where each burst is smeared out by an amount corresponding to its position uncertainty. We also present separate band-pass filtered sky maps for the quadrupole term and for the multipole-ranges l=3-10 and l=11-30, so that the fluctuations on different angular scales can be separately inspected for visual features such as localized ``hot spots" or structures aligned with the Galactic plane. These filtered maps reveal no apparent deviations from isotropy.}}

    Abstract = {A convolution of the all-sky survey data with a smoothing function is crucial in calculating the smooth surface brightness of the sky survey data. The convolution is usually performed using a spherical version of the convolution theorem. However, a Gaussian function, applicable only in the flat-sky approximation, has been usually adopted as a smoothing kernel. In this paper, we present an exact analytic solution of the spherical-harmonics transformation of a Fisher-von Mises function, the mathematical version of a Gaussian function in spherical space. We also obtain the approximate solutions $\exp[-l(l+1)/2\kappa]$. The exact and the approximate solutions may be useful when an astrophysical survey map is convolved with a smoothing function of $\kappa\gtrsim1$.},

We adopt the harmonic scaling idea for the spherical dilation operator recently proposed by Sanz et al. but extend the analysis to a more general directional framework. Directional wavelets are a powerful extension that allow one to also probe oriented structure in the analysed function. Our spherical wavelet methodology has the advantage that all functions and operators are defined directly on the sphere. The construction of wavelets in our framework is demonstrated with an example.},

All of these transforms can be inverted i.e. we can exactly reconstruct the original data from its coefficients in either representation. Several applications are described. We show how these transforms can be used in denoising and especially in a Combined Filtering Method, which uses both the wavelet and the curvelet transforms, thus benefiting from the advantages of both transforms. An application to component separation from multichannel data mapped to the sphere is also described in which we take advantage of moving to a wavelet representation.}}

    Title = {Fast Directional Correlation on the Sphere with Steerable Filters},
    Volume = {652},
    Year = {2006},
    Abstract = {A fast algorithm is developed for the directional correlation of scalar band-limited signals and band-limited steerable filters on the sphere. The asymptotic complexity associated with it through simple quadrature is of order O(L^5), where 2L stands for the square root of the number of sampling points on the sphere, also setting a band limit L for the signals and filters considered. The filter steerability allows us to compute the directional correlation uniquely in terms of direct and inverse scalar spherical harmonics transforms, which drive the overall asymptotic complexity. The ``separation of variables'' technique for a scalar spherical harmonics transform produces an O(L^3) algorithm independent of the pixelization. On equiangular pixelizations, a sampling theorem introduced by Driscoll and Healy implies the exactness of the algorithm. The equiangular and HEALPix implementations are compared in terms of memory requirements, computation times, and numerical stability. The computation times for the scalar transform, and hence for the directional correlation, of maps of several megapixels on the sphere (L\approx 10^3) are reduced from years to tens of seconds in both implementations on a single standard computer. These generic results for the scale-space signal processing on the sphere are specifically developed in the perspective of the wavelet analysis of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature (T) and polarization (E and B) maps of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and Planck experiments. As an illustration, we consider the computation of the wavelet coefficients of a simulated temperature map of several megapixels with the second Gaussian derivative wavelet.}}

    Abstract = {In vivo quantification of neuroanatomical shape variations is possible due to recent advances in medical imaging and has proven useful in the study of neuropathology and neurodevelopment. In this paper, we apply a spherical wavelet transformation to extract shape features of cortical surfaces reconstructed from magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of a set of subjects. The spherical wavelet transformation can characterize the underlying functions in a local fashion in both space and frequency, in contrast to spherical harmonics that have a global basis set. We perform principal component analysis (PCA) on these wavelet shape features to study patterns of shape variation within normal population from coarse to fine resolution. In addition, we study the development of cortical folding in newborns using the Gompertz model in the wavelet domain, which allows us to characterize the order of development of large-scale and finer folding patterns independently. Given a limited amount of training data, we use a regularization framework to estimate the parameters of the Gompertz model to improve the prediction performance on new data. We develop an efficient method to estimate this regularized Gompertz model based on the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shannon (BFGS) approximation. Promising results are presented using both PCA and the folding development model in the wavelet domain. The cortical folding development model provides quantitative anatomic information regarding macroscopic cortical folding development and may be of potential use as a biomarker for early diagnosis of neurologic deficits in newborns.}}

  abstract={New full-sky temperature and polarization maps based on seven years of data from WMAP are presented. The new results are consistent with previous results, but have improved due to reduced noise from the additional integration time, improved knowledge of the instrument performance, and improved data analysis procedures. The improvements are described in detail. The seven-year data set is well fit by a minimal six-parameter flat ?CDM model. The parameters for this model, using the WMAP data in conjunction with baryon acoustic oscillation data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and priors on H 0 from Hubble Space Telescope observations, are O b h 2 = 0.02260 ± 0.00053, O c h 2 = 0.1123 ± 0.0035, O ? = 0.728 +0.015 –0.016 , n s = 0.963 ± 0.012, t = 0.087 ± 0.014, and s 8 = 0.809 ± 0.024 (68% CL uncertainties). The temperature power spectrum signal-to-noise ratio per multipole is greater that unity for multipoles l ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 919, allowing a robust measurement of the third acoustic peak. This measurement results in improved constraints on the matter density, O m h 2 = 0.1334 +0.0056 –0.0055 , and the epoch of matter-radiation equality, z eq = 3196 +134 –133 , using WMAP data alone. The new WMAP data, when combined with smaller angular scale microwave background anisotropy data, result in a 3s detection of the abundance of primordial helium, Y He = 0.326 ± 0.075. When combined with additional external data sets, the WMAP data also yield better determinations of the total mass of neutrinos, ? m ? = 0.58 eV(95%CL), and the effective number of neutrino species, N eff = 4.34 +0.86 –0.88 . The power-law index of the primordial power spectrum is now determined to be n s = 0.963 ± 0.012, excluding the Harrison-Zel'dovich-Peebles spectrum by >3s. These new WMAP measurements provide important tests of big bang cosmology.}

This paper includes a comprehensive catalog of data windows along with their significant performance parameters from which the different windows can be compared.

    Abstract = {We propose fast, exact and efficient algorithms for the convolution of two arbitrary functions on the sphere which speed up computations by a factor $O(\sqrt{N})$ compared to present methods where N is the number of pixels. No simplifying assumptions are made other than band limitation. This reduces typical computation times for convolving the full sky with the asymmetric beam pattern of a megapixel cosmic microwave background (CMB) mission from months to minutes. Our methods enable realistic simulation and careful analysis of data from such missions, taking into account the effects of asymmetric ``point spread functions'' and far side lobes of the physical beam. While motivated by CMB studies, our methods are general and hence applicable to the convolution or filtering of any scalar field on the sphere with an arbitrary, asymmetric kernel. We show in an Appendix that the same ideas can be applied to the inverse problems of map-making and beam reconstruction by similarly accelerating the transpose convolution which is needed for the iterative solution of the normal equations.}}

    Abstract = {The large spectral efficiencies promised for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless fading channels are derived under certain conditions which do not fully take into account the spatial aspects of the channel. Spatial correlation, due to limited angular spread or insufficient antenna spacing, significantly reduces the performance of MIMO systems. In this paper we explore the effects of spatially selective channels on the capacity of MIMO systems via a new capacity expression which is more general and realistic than previous expressions. By including spatial information we derive a closed-form expression for ergodic capacity which uses the physics of signal propagation combined with the statistics of the scattering environment. This expression gives the capacity of a MIMO system in terms of antenna placement and scattering environment and leads to valuable insights into the factors determining capacity for a wide range of scattering models.},

    Abstract = {This correspondence studies a spatially localized spectral transform for signals on the unit sphere, which we call spatially localized spherical harmonics transform (SLSHT). For a systematic treatment, we explicitly express the transform in terms of rotated versions of an azimuthally symmetric window function and introduce the spatio-spectral SLSHT distribution with a succinct matrix representation. We present guidelines for the choice of the window function in the SLSHT, based on the inherent tradeoff between the spatial and spectral resolution of different window functions from the perspective of the uncertainty principle. We demonstrate the use of an eigenfunction window, obtained from the Slepian concentration problem on the sphere, as a good choice for window function. As an illustration, we apply the transform to the topographic map of Mars, which can reveal spatially localized spectral contributions that were not obtainable from traditional spherical harmonics analysis.},

    Title = {Theory and design of broadband sensor arrays with frequency invariant far-field beam patterns},
    Volume = {97},
    Year = {1995},
    Abstract = {The theory and design of a broadband array of sensors with a frequency invariant far-field beam pattern over an arbitrarily wide design bandwidth is presented. The frequency invariant beam pattern property is defined in terms of a continuously distributed sensor, and the problem of designing a practical sensor array is then treated as an approximation to this continuous sensor using a discrete set of filtered broadband omnidirectional array elements. The design methodology is suitable for one-, two-, and three-dimensional sensor arrays; it imposes no restrictions on the desired aperture distribution (beam shape), and can cope with arbitrarily wide bandwidths. An important consequence of the results is that the frequency response of the filter applied to the output of each sensor can be factored into two components: One component is related to a slice of the desired aperture distribution, and the other is sensor independent. The results also indicate that the locations of the sensors are not a crucial design consideration, although it is shown that nonuniform spacings simultaneously avoid spatial aliasing and minimize the number of sensors. An example design which covers a 10:1 frequency range (which is suitable for speech acquisition using a microphone array) illustrates the utility of the method. Finally, the theory is generalized to cover a parameterized class of arrays in which the frequency dependence of the beam pattern can be controlled in a continuous manner from a classical single-frequency design to a frequency invariant design.},

    Title = {Localized spectral analysis on the sphere},
    Volume = {162},
    Year = {2005},
    Abstract = {It is often advantageous to investigate the relationship between two geophysical data sets in the spectral domain by calculating admittance and coherence functions. While there exist powerful Cartesian windowing techniques to estimate spatially localized (cross-)spectral properties, the inherent sphericity of planetary bodies sometimes necessitates an approach based in spherical coordinates. Direct localized spectral estimates on the sphere can be obtained by tapering, or multiplying the data by a suitable windowing function, and expanding the resultant field in spherical harmonics. The localization of a window in space and its spectral bandlimitation jointly determine the quality of the spatiospectral estimation. Two kinds of axisymmetric windows are here constructed that are ideally suited to this purpose: bandlimited functions that maximize their spatial energy within a cap of angular radius \theta_0, and spacelimited functions that maximize their spectral power within a spherical harmonic bandwidth $L$. Both concentration criteria yield an eigenvalue problem that is solved by an orthogonal family of data tapers, and the properties of these windows depend almost entirely upon the space--bandwidth product $N_0=(L+1)\theta_0/\pi$. The first $N_0-1$ windows are near perfectly concentrated, and the best-concentrated window approaches a lower bound imposed by a spherical uncertainty principle. In order to make robust localized estimates of the admittance and coherence spectra between two fields on the sphere, we propose a method analogous to Cartesian multitaper spectral analysis that uses our optimally concentrated data tapers. We show that the expectation of localized (cross-)power spectra calculated using our data tapers is nearly unbiased for stochastic processes when the input spectrum is white and when averages are made over all possible realizations of the random variables. In physical situations, only one realization of such a process will be available, but in this case, a weighted average of the spectra obtained using multiple data tapers well approximates the expected spectrum. While developed primarily to solve problems in planetary science, our method has applications in all areas of science that investigate spatiospectral relationships between data fields defined on a sphere.},

The basic gal is to devise a distribution that represents the energy or intensity of a signal simultaneously in time and frequency. Although the basic notions have been developing steadily over the last 40 years, there have recently been significant advances. This review is intended to be understandable to the nonspecialist with emphasis on the diversity of concepts and motivations that have gone into the formation of the field}}

    Volume = {388},

    Abstract = {A new formalism is derived for the analysis and exact reconstruction of band-limited signals on the sphere with directional wavelets. It represents an evolution of a previously developed wavelet formalism developed by Antoine & Vandergheynst and Wiaux et al. The translations of the wavelets at any point on the sphere and their proper rotations are still defined through the continuous three-dimensional rotations. The dilations of the wavelets are directly defined in harmonic space through a new kernel dilation, which is a modification of an existing harmonic dilation. A family of factorized steerable functions with compact harmonic support which are suitable for this kernel dilation are first identified. A scale-discretized wavelet formalism is then derived, relying on this dilation. The discrete nature of the analysis scales allows the exact reconstruction of band-limited signals. A corresponding exact multi-resolution algorithm is finally described and an implementation is tested. The formalism is of interest notably for the denoising or the deconvolution of signals on the sphere with a sparse expansion in wavelets. In astrophysics, it finds a particular application for the identification of localized directional features in the cosmic microwave background data, such as the imprint of topological defects, in particular, cosmic strings, and for their reconstruction after separation from the other signal components.}}

We quantitatively compare our results with a standard map-making method and demonstrate that the true sky is recovered with high accuracy using deconvolution map-making.}}

    Volume = {59},
    Year = {2011},
    Abstract = {This paper introduces a quadratic variational framework for solving a broad class of signal design problems on the 2-sphere. The functional, to be extremized, combines energy concentration measures using a weighting function in the spatial domain, multiplicative weights in the spectral domain, and a total energy constraint. This leads to two formulations of the signal design problem on the 2- sphere, one a Fredholm integral equation in the spatial domain and the other an infinite matrix equation in the spectral domain. The framework is illustrated by deriving the key equations for the two classical spatio-spectral concentration problems on the 2-sphere, and for an isotropic filter design that maximizes the filtered energy. In addition, using the proposed framework, we formulate a joint 3- D beamforming application which achieves optimal directivity and spatial resolution simultaneously.},

    Volume = {15},
    Year = {1994},
    Abstract = {This paper considers the problem of efficient computation of the spherical harmonic expansion, or Fourier transform, of functions defined on the two dimensional sphere, S2. The resulting algorithms are applied to the efficient computation of convolutions of functions on the sphere. We begin by proving convolution theorems generalizing well known and useful results from the abelian case. These convolution theorems are then used to develop a sampling theorem on the sphere. which reduces the calculation of Fourier transforms and convolutions of band-limited functions to discrete computations. We show how to perform these efficiently, starting with an O(n(log n)2) time algorithm for computing the Legendre transform of a function defined on the interval [-1,1] sampled at n points there. Theoretical and experimental results on the effects of finite precision arithmetic are presented. The Legendre transform algorithm is then generalized to obtain an algorithm for the Fourier transform, requiring O(n(log n)2) time, and an algorithm for its inverse in O(n1.5) time, where n is the number of points on the sphere at which the function is sampled. This improves the naive O(n2) bound, which is the best previously known. These transforms give an O(n1.5) algorithm for convolving two functions on the sphere.}}

The approach is equivalent to Gaussian smoothing on the sphere and is computationally efficient since it does not require iterative smoothing. Furthermore, it does not suffer from the well-known shrinkage problem. Evolution of important shape features (parabolic curves) under diffusion is demonstrated. A nonlinear modification of the diffusion process is introduced in order to improve smoothing behavior of elongated and poorly centered objects.},

    Abstract = {We pose and solve the analogue of Slepian's time-frequency concentration problem on the surface of the unit sphere to determine an orthogonal family of strictly bandlimited functions that are optimally concentrated within a closed region of the sphere or, alterna- tively, of strictly spacelimited functions that are optimally concentrated in the spherical harmonic domain. Such a basis of simultaneously spatially and spectrally concentrated functions should be a useful data analysis and representation tool in a variety of geophysi- cal and planetary applications, as well as in medical imaging, computer science, cosmology, and numerical analysis. The spherical Slepian functions can be found by solving either an algebraic eigenvalue problem in the spectral domain or a Fredholm integral equation in the spatial domain. The associated eigenvalues are a measure of the spatiospectral concen- tration. When the concentration region is an axisymmetric polar cap, the spatiospectral projection operator commutes with a Sturm-Liouville operator; this enables the eigenfunc- tions to be computed extremely accurately and efficiently, even when their area-bandwidth product, or Shannon number, is large. In the asymptotic limit of a small spatial region and a large spherical harmonic bandwidth, the spherical concentration problem reduces to its planar equivalent, which exhibits self-similarity when the Shannon number is kept invariant.},

    Abstract = {We develop a method for spatio-spectral localization of harmonic data on a sphere and use it to interpret recent high-resolution global estimates of the gravity and topography of Venus in the context of geodynamical models. Our approach applies equally to the simple spatial windowing of harmonic data and to variable-length-scale analyses, which are analogous to a wavelet transform in the Cartesian domain. Using the variable-length-scale approach, we calculate the localized RMS amplitudes of gravity and topography, as well as the spectral admittance between the two fields, as functions of position and wavelength. The observed admittances over 10 per cent of the surface of Venus (highland plateaus and tessera regions) are consistent with isostatic compensation of topography by variations in crustal thickness, while admittances over the remaining 90 per cent of the surface (rises, plains and lowlands) indicate that long-wavelength topography is dominantly the result of vertical convective tractions at the base of the lithosphere. The global average crustal thickness is less than 30 km, but can reach values as large as 40 km beneath tesserae and highland plateaus. We also note that an Earth-like radial viscosity structure cannot be rejected by the gravity and topography data and that, without a mechanical model of the lithosphere, admittance values cannot constrain the thickness of the thermal boundary layer of Venus. Modelling the lithosphere as a thin elastic plate indicates that at the time of formation of relief in highland plateaus and tesserae, the effective elastic plate thickness, Te, was less than 20 km. Estimates of Te at highland rises are consistently less than 30 km. Our inability to find regions with Te > 30 km is inconsistent with predictions made by a class of catastrophic resurfacing models.},

    Volume = {116},
    Year = 2011,
    Abstract = {The spectral relations (admittance and correlation) between gravity and topography are often used to obtain information on the density structure, flexural support, and heat flow of planetary lithospheres. Mapping spatial variations in these quantities requires spatiospectral analysis techniques. Here we describe the application of a directional, continuous spherical wavelet transform using a wavelet basis constructed from the superposition of azimuthally adjacent complex Morlet wavelets, in a manner similar to the ``fan'' wavelet developed in the plane. The method is applied to gravity and topography of the Earth, Venus, Mars, and the Moon. The wavelet coefficients are used to compute isotropic and directional wavelet autospectra and cross spectra, which are then combined to form the admittance and correlation functions. The resulting maps offer insights into lithospheric structure of the terrestrial planets. In particular we show that the Earth and Venus have uniformly low positive admittance and high correlation, whereas Mars and the Moon display hemispherical contrasts with large negative and anisotropic coefficients coinciding with lowlands. As has long been known, the two largest impact basins in the inner solar system, the South Pole-Aitken basin on the Moon and the Hellas basin on Mars, display low positive admittance and high correlation, indicating isostatic compensation. In contrast, most other impact basins, particularly the Martian and lunar mascons, show negative coefficients at low wavelet degrees suggesting flexural support by a strong lithosphere. These results imply that, although simple isotropic flexural models can account for most observations, future models may need to incorporate anisotropy as an additional parameter.},

    Abstract = {Filtering is critical for representing detail, such as color textures or normal maps, across a variety of scales. While MIP-mapping texture maps is commonplace, accurate normal map filtering remains a challenging problem because of nonlinearities in shading---we cannot simply average nearby surface normals. In this paper, we show analytically that normal map filtering can be formalized as a spherical convolution of the normal distribution function (NDF) and the BRDF, for a large class of common BRDFs such as Lambertian, microfacet and factored measurements. This theoretical result explains many previous filtering techniques as special cases, and leads to a generalization to a broader class of measured and analytic BRDFs. Our practical algorithms leverage a significant body of work that has studied lighting-BRDF convolution. We show how spherical harmonics can be used to filter the NDF for Lambertian and low-frequency specular BRDFs, while spherical von Mises-Fisher distributions can be used for high-frequency materials.},

While recent advances have extended some filtering methods to spherical images, many key challenges remain. In this paper, we develop theoretical conditions for the invertibility of filter banks under continuous spherical convolution. Furthermore, we present an analogue of the Papoulis generalized sampling theorem on the 2-Sphere. We use the theoretical results to establish a general framework for the design of invertible filter banks on the sphere and demonstrate the approach with examples of self-invertible spherical wavelets and steerable pyramids. We conclude by examining the use of a self-invertible spherical steerable pyramid in a denoising experiment and discussing the computational complexity of the filtering framework.}}
