\chapter*{Abstract}

This thesis is focussed on the development of new signal processing
techniques to analyse signals defined on the sphere. Analysis
and processing of signals defined on the sphere find applications in
various fields of science and engineering, such as cosmology,
geophysics and medical imaging. The objective to develop new signal
processing methods is served by formulating, extending and tailoring
existing Euclidean domain signal processing theories in ways
that they become suitable for analysis of signals defined on the
sphere.

The first part of this thesis develops a new type of convolution
between two signals on the sphere. This is the first type of
convolution on the sphere which is commutative. Two other
advantages, in comparison with existing definitions in the
literature, are that the new convolution admits anisotropic filters
and signals and the domain of the output remains on the sphere. The
spectral analysis of the convolution is provided and a fast
algorithm for efficient computation of convolution output is
developed.

The second part of the thesis is focused on the development of
signal processing techniques to analyse signals on the sphere in
joint spatio-spectral~(spatial-spectral) domain. A transform
analogous to short-time Fourier transform~(STFT) in time-frequency
analysis is formulated for signals defined on the sphere, in order
to devise a spatio-spectral representation of a signal. The proposed
transform is referred as the spatially localized spherical harmonic
transform~(SLSHT) and is defined as windowed spherical harmonic
transform, resulting in the SLSHT distribution. The properties of
the SLSHT distribution and its analysis in the spherical harmonic domain are
also provided. Furthermore, examples are provided to demonstrate
the capability of SLSHT to reveal spatially localized spectral
contents in a signal that were not obtainable from traditional
spherical harmonics analysis. With the consideration that data-sets
on the sphere can be of considerable size and the SLSHT is
intrinsically computationally demanding depending on the band-limits
of the signal and window, a fast algorithm for the efficient
computation of the transform is developed.  The floating point
precision numerical accuracy of the fast algorithm is demonstrated
and a full numerical complexity analysis is presented.

A general framework for spatially-varying spectral filtering of
signals defined on the unit sphere is also developed, as an analogy
to joint time-frequency filtering. For spatio-spectral filtering,
the spherical signals are first mapped from the spatial domain into
a joint spatio-spectral domain using SLSHT, where a spatio-spectral
signal transformation or modification is introduced. Next, a
suitable scheme to transform the modified signal from the
spatio-spectral domain back to an admissible signal in the spatial
domain using the least squares approach is proposed. It is shown
that the overall action of the SLSHT and spatio-spectral signal
modification can be described through a single transformation
matrix, which is useful in practice. Finally, two specific and
useful instances of spatially-varying spectral filtering are
presented, defined through multiplicative and convolutive
modification of the SLSHT distribution. The proposed framework
enables filtering or modification in the spatio-spectral domain
which cannot be carried out in either the spatial or spectral domain.
