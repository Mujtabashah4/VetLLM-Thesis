\chapter{Conclusions and Future Research Directions}\label{chap7:chapter7}

In this chapter we summarize the general conclusions drawn from this
thesis.  The summary of specific contributions can be found at the
end of each chapter and are not repeated here. We also outline some
future research directions arising from this work.


\section{Conclusions}

This thesis has been primarily concerned with the development of new
signal processing techniques and the extension of existing theories
to analyze signals defined on the sphere.

First, in Chapter 3, we have considered the problem to define and
formulate convolution on the sphere in a manner that serves as direct analog
of the Euclidean domain convolution. In contrast to the existing
definitions of convolution, we have formulated convolution on the
sphere which is commutative in nature, admits anisotropic filter and
produces an output that remains on the sphere.


In the second part of the thesis, from Chapter 4 to Chapter 6, we
focussed on analysis of signals on the sphere in a joint
spatio-spectral domain. Analogous to the STFT in time-frequency
analysis, we developed the SLSHT, composed of spatial windowing followed
by a spherical harmonic transform, to obtain the spatio-spectral
representation of the signal. It has been shown that the
spatio-spectral representation, herein, referred to as the SLSHT
distribution represents the spatially varying spectral contents and
therefore reveals information about the localization of spectral
contents which cannot be directly obtained from the spectral domain
representation of a signal. Since the SLSHT distribution relies on a
window function for spatial localization, different window functions
have been studied from the perspective of the uncertainty principle.
Noting that the eigenfunction obtained from the Slepian concentration
problem on the sphere attains the lower bound imposed by uncertainty
principle, we have proposed to use this eigenfunction as window function
in obtaining SLSHT distribution of a signal. New uncertainty
principles, which relate the concentration of a signal in spatial
and spectral domain, have also been derived.

Earlier, in Chapter 4, we used azimuthally symmetric window functions
for spatial localization in order to parameterize the SLSHT
distribution on $\untsph$. Later, we extended the development of
the SLSHT in Chapter 6, where an azimuthally asymmetric window function is
used for spatial localization and the spatio-spectral representation
is referred to as the directional SLSHT distribution. The use of an asymmetric
window function enables the SLSHT to also reveal localization of
\emph{directional} features in the spatio-spectral domain. Due to
the fact the rotation is fully characterized by the consideration of
all three Euler angles, the asymmetric window provides SO(3) spatial
localization and therefore the directional SLSHT distribution is
parameterized on SO(3) instead of $\untsph$. Since the data-sets on
the sphere may be of large size, and the SLSHT distribution of a signal must 
be computed for each spatial position and for each
spectral component, we have developed fast algorithms for efficient
computation of the SLSHT distribution.

The spatially localized spherical harmonic transform (SLSHT)
distribution, representing the spatially-varying spectrum of a
signal on the unit sphere, presents a mechanism to transform, modify
and filter the signal in the joint spatio-spectral domain to realize
spatially varying spectral filtering.  As in the time-frequency
analogy, such a transformation in the spatio-spectral domain can
lead to a modified distribution that is not the SLSHT distribution of
a physically valid spatial signal.  Therefore, we formulated and
solved an optimization problem to find the closest physically valid
signal to the modified SLHT distribution. We illustrated two types
of transformation to the SLSHT distribution, multiplicative
modification and convolutive modification, both being instances of a
general linear integral operator. It has been shown that the
proposed framework enables the processing of signals in the joint
spatio-spectral domain in a way that cannot be accomplished
separately in either spatial or spectral domain.


\section{Future Research Directions}

A number of interesting future research directions arise from the work presented in this thesis.\\

\begin{itemize}

\item The capability of the 
SLSHT distribution to reveal localized contribution of spectral
contents depends on the window function being used for spatial
localization. Considering that there exists a localization trade-off
for a window function in the spatial and spectral domains, the choice of
window function affects the resulting SLSHT distribution. Use of
the same window function to achieve localization
for all spatial positions may not be adequate to find what spectral
components exist at different spatial positions. Lower spatial
resolution window should be used in the region of lower degree
spectral components. Higher spatial resolution window must be
employed in the region that contains localized higher degree
spectral components in order to distinguish spatially varying
spectral components at different spatial positions. Therefore, there
is a need to investigate the use of different resolution window
functions at different spatial positions to achieve localization,
such that the resolution of the window function adapts to the
characteristics of the signal being analyzed. An analogous problem
is well known in time-frequency
analysis~\cite{Jones:1992,Baraniuk:1993,Jones:1997}, where it has
been shown that, according to several different measures of
performance, the optimal window function for STFT depends on the
signal being analyzed.

\item In this thesis, we have studied the SLSHT distribution as
spatio-spectral representation of signals on the sphere. The
SLSHT has been formulated in analogy with the STFT in time-frequency
analysis. There exist more sophisticated, different types of
time-frequency distributions in the literature with different
properties~\cite{Cohen:1989}. Potentially, these existing techniques
need to extended and tailored for signals on the sphere. For
example, the ambiguity function for signals on the sphere formulated
in \cite{Khalid_icassp_2:2012} can be used to develop a general
class of spatio-spectral distributions for signals on the sphere
similar to the Cohen class of time-frequency
distributions~\cite{Cohen:1989,Cohen:1995}.


\item  In Chapter 5, we presented a framework for transformation of signals in the spatio-spectral domain. There are natural generalizations of the proposed framework. The
technique we developed to recover a spectral response of a valid
signal on the unit sphere from a modified SLSHT distribution is not
limited to linear transformations in the spatio-spectral domain.
Since there exist efficient computational techniques to
\emph{exactly} evaluate the spherical harmonic transform of the
the band-limited signals~\cite{Driscoll:1994,McEwen:2011}, we have
considered the signal in the spectral domain in the proposed
mathematical developments and formulations. We consider the
development of efficient computational techniques to do signal
processing in spatio-spectral domain an open problem for further
work.


\item The problem of optimal filtering on the sphere has been investigated in \cite{McEwen:2008,Arora:2010} and applied in
\cite{Mcewen:bubble_filters:2012} for the detection of bubble
collision signatures in WMAP 7-year
observations~\cite{Jarosik:2010}. Following the explorations and
research on the filtering of Euclidean signals in the time-frequency
domain using STFT~\cite{Hlawatsch:2000}, the proposed SLSHT
distribution can be used to formulate the optimal filtering in the
joint spatio-spectral domain for signals on the sphere.
