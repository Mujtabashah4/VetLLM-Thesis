In time-frequency analysis, the short-time Fourier transform~(STFT)
has been widely explored, investigated and used in many applications
to analyze the localized spectral contents of the
signal~\cite{Cohen:1989,Cohen:1995,Czerwinski:1997,Kramer:1994,Hlawatsch:1990}.
In this chapter, we develop a tool analogous to the STFT for signals defined on the unit sphere. The
objective is to devise a distribution that represents how the signal
spectrum varies in the spatial domain. We propose a transform, which
we call the spatially localized spherical harmonic
transform~(SLSHT), as an analog of STFT to represent the signal
jointly in spatial and spectral domains. For this purpose, we focus
on the use of azimuthally symmetric window functions to achieve
localization in the spatial domain and express the transform in
terms of the rotation applied to the original window. We also give a
succinct matrix representation of all possible SLSHT components,
which we refer to as the SLSHT distribution. We also present a
distribution transform operation inspired by the characteristic
function in time-frequency analysis~\cite{Cohen:1989,Cohen:1995},
which transforms SLSHT distribution into a new spatio-spectral
distribution which we call the complementary distribution.

We discuss the inherent trade-off between the spatial and spectral
resolution of different window functions from the perspective of the
uncertainty principle. This will help us in determining suitable
choices for window functions for SLSHT. We propose and demonstrate
the use of an eigenfunction window, obtained from the Slepian
concentration problem on the sphere~\cite{Wieczorek:2007}, as a good
choice for the window function in the SLSHT. As an illustration, we
apply the SLSHT distribution with eigenfunction window to the
example of the Mars topographic map and show that the localized
contributions of spherical harmonics are apparent in the
spatio-spectral domain.

The chapter is organized as follows. We summarize STFT in
time-frequency analysis and its properties briefly in
Section~\ref{sec:t_f_stft}. The proposed spatially localized
spherical harmonic transform, its matrix formulation and signal
inversion are presented in Section~\ref{ch4:sec:SLSHT}. The
complementary distribution and its properties are defined in
Section~\ref{sec:inversion_complementary}. The window localization
trade-off is discussed in Section~\ref{ch4:sec:window} and an
example to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed transform are
presented in Section~\ref{ch4:sec:results}.

\section{Time-Frequency Signal Analysis using Short Time Fourier Transform}\label{sec:t_f_stft}

A time domain signal can be equivalently represented in the
frequency domain. While there is an equivalence between the signal
representations in these two domains, the signal in one domain does
not explicitly convey information about the localized contents in the other domain.
Time-frequency signal processing deals with the analysis and
processing of signals in a joint time-frequency domain.
%
\subsection{Short-Time Fourier Transform~(STFT)}

The short-time Fourier transform~(STFT) is a powerful tool which is
widely used in time-frequency analysis to investigate  time
localized
spectral characteristics of a signal~\cite{Cohen:1989,Cohen:1995}. %The STFT of the signal
%reflects the frequency characteristic as a function of time.
In order to study the time domain signal $f$ in the vicinity of time
$t$ in frequency domain, a window function is used and Fourier
analysis is performed. The STFT is given by
%the signal is localized at time $t$ using the
%window function and then the Fourier analysis is performed. For a
%window function $h(t)$, STFT $\stftf(t,\omega)$ of signal $f(t)$ is
%defined as
\begin{align}\label{Eq:stft_tf_def}
\stftf(t,\omega) = \int f(\tau)\,{h(t -\tau)}\, e^{-i \omega
\tau}\,d\tau,
\end{align}
%
where a time-shift of the window function, $h$, provides the
localization in time. Hence, the time-frequency distribution using
the STFT is the collection of Fourier transforms of the windowed
signal about all points of translation $t$.  For brevity, the
notation for the STFT, $\stftf(t,\omega)$ in \eqref{Eq:stft_tf_def},
suppresses the dependence on $h$.

The effectiveness of the STFT in \eqref{Eq:stft_tf_def} for various
applications is sensitive to the selection of window function
$h$~\cite{Cohen:1995,Czerwinski:1997,Zhong:2010}. The basic problem
in window selection is the trade-off between a greater window width
for better frequency resolution and a lesser window width for
capturing the localized temporal properties of the signal~\cite{Czerwinski:1997}. %A window
%function with greater/lesser width in the time domain produces greater/lesser
%resolution in the frequency domain. %because of spectral smoothing,
%whereas a lesser width window fails to capture the localized
%contents in the frequency domain.

\subsection{Signal Inversion from STFT Distribution}

The STFT representation of the signal in \eqref{Eq:stft_tf_def}
belongs to the class of linear representations which satisfy simple
reconstruction properties~\cite{Cohen:1989,Cohen:1995}. %The marginal of the
%distribution in one domain can be obtained by integrating out the
%other domain.
The signal $f(t)$ can be recovered from its STFT representation
$\stftf(t,\omega)$, up to a constant factor, through the weighted
marginal
%
\begin{align}\label{Eq:stft_tf_inversion_1}
\int \stftf(t,\omega)\, e^{i\omega t}\,d\omega = C_1\, f(t)
\end{align}
%
and the Fourier transform $F(\omega)$ of the signal $f(t)$ can be
obtained from $\stftf(t,\omega)$ as frequency marginal which is
obtained by integrating out the time variable as
%
\begin{align}\label{Eq:stft_tf_inversion_2}
\int \stftf(t,\omega)\,dt = C_2\, F(\omega),
\end{align}
%
where $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants which depend upon the window
function.


\subsection{Characteristic Function for STFT Distribution}

The characteristic function has been widely used to study the
localized characteristics of time-frequency
distributions~\cite{Cohen:1989,Cohen:1995}. The characteristic
function $M(\varsigma,\tau)$ for the STFT representation
$\stftf(t,\omega)$ is defined as~\cite{Cohen:1989}
%
\begin{align}\label{Eq:Ch_tf_def}
M(\varsigma, \tau) = \iint \big|\stftf(t,\omega)\big|^2 \, e^{i
\varsigma t} \, e^{i \tau \omega}\, dt\,d\omega.
\end{align}
%
We can see that the characteristic function $M(\varsigma,\tau)$ is a
transformed distribution which is equivalent to the two dimensional
inverse Fourier transform of the squared magnitude of the STFT
distribution $\stftf(t,\omega)$ in \eqref{Eq:stft_tf_def}. We make it clear here that the we are interested in the STFT based time-frequency representation of a signal, whereas the term ``time-frequency distributions" in this thesis is used to represent large class of time-frequency representations of a signal~\cite{Cohen:1989,Cohen:1995}.

\section{Spatially Localized Spherical Harmonic Transform}\label{ch4:sec:SLSHT}

\subsection{Definition of SLSHT}
\label{sec:dfnslsht}

We define the SLSHT in analogy to the STFT in time-frequency
analysis. Judicious choices of rotations on the sphere serve as
counterparts of translations in \eqref{Eq:stft_tf_def} in the time
domain. We re-locate, through rotation, an azimuthally-symmetric
window function (centered at the north pole) to achieve localization
in the spatial domain. We first define the SLSHT and use it to
define the SLSHT distribution as spatio-spectral representation of
the signal.



\begin{definition}[Spatially Localized Spherical Harmonic Transform]
For a  signal \mbox{$f\in\lsph$}, define the directional SLSHT
 $g(\unit{y};{\ell},m) \in \lsph$ of
degree $\ell$ and order
  $m$ as the spherical harmonic transform of a localized signal where
  localization is provided by the rotation operator $\rotopz$ acting on azimuthally symmetric window function
  $h\in\lsph$, i.e.,
  %
\begin{align}
    \label{Eq:stft_spatial1}
        g(\unit{y};{\ell},m) = g(\unit{y};n) \dfn
        \intsph
        \parn[\big]{\rotopz h}(\unit{x})     &     f(\unit{x}) \conj{Y_{\ell}^m(\unit{x})}
         \,ds(\unit{x}), \nonumber \\ &\unit{y} = \unit{y}(\vartheta,\varphi), \,
        (\ell,m)\leftrightarrow n.
\end{align}
\end{definition}

The SLSHT is dependent on the chosen window $h$, but for brevity,
this dependence is not explicit in the notation. We emphasize that, unlike the spherical harmonic coefficient of the signal $f$,
$\shc{f}{\ell}{m}$, which is only a function of degree $\ell$ and
order $m$, the SLSHT provides a spatially-varying spherical harmonic
representation of the signal (i.e., $g(\unit{y};{\ell},m)$ is a
function of the spatial localization $\unit{y}$ and degree and
order). We call $g(\unit{y};{\ell},m)$ the SLSHT of degree $\ell$ and
order $m$.

\subsection{SLSHT Harmonic Expansion}
Here, we express the relation between the SLSHT
$g(\unit{y};{\ell},m)$ and the spherical harmonic coefficients of
the signal $f$. First we determine the spherical harmonic
coefficients corresponding to the rotated window. We are interested
in the case where both the signal $f(\unit{x})$ and the window kernel
$h(\unit{x})$ are band-limited. Let us assume that $f(\unit{x})\in
\lsphL{L_f}$ and  $h(\unit{x})\in \lsphL{L_h}$ (since the kernel is
assumed to be azimuthally symmetric, $h(\unit{x})\in \lsphL{L_h}^0
\subset \lsphz$ would be a more precise notation).


Specializing \eqref{eqn:rotation_symm} for the SLSHT window kernel
$h$ at point $\unit{x} = \unit{x}(\theta,\varphi)$, we define

\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:window_r}
    \shc{h}{r}{}(\unit{y}) \dfn \innerp[\big]{\rotopz h}{Y_r} =
    \sqrt{\frac{4\pi}{2p+1}}\conj{Y_p^q(\unit{y})} \shc{h}{p}{0}, \quad \unit{y}
    = \unit{y}(\vartheta,\varphi), \quad (p,q)\leftrightarrow r.
\end{equation}
%
%
Using \eqref{Eq:window_r}, \eqref{Eq:f_expansion}, \eqref{Eq:fcoeff} and the mapping $(s,t)\leftrightarrow u$, we can alternatively write $g(\unit{y};n)$ in \eqref{Eq:stft_spatial1} as %
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:stft_spectral}
    g(\unit{y};n) = \sum_{u=0}^{N_f}  \shc{f}{u}{} \sum_{r=0}^{N_h}
\shc{h}{r}{}(\unit{y})\,T(u;r;n),
\end{equation}
where $N_h=L_h^2+2L_h$ and
\begin{equation}
\label{Ch4:Eq:triple_prod_abc}
    T(u;r;n) = T(r;u;n) \dfn \intsph Y_r(\unit{x}) Y_u(\unit{x}) \conj{Y_n(\unit{x})} \,ds(\unit{x})
\end{equation}
denotes the spherical harmonic triple product, the explicit
expression of which is provided in \eqref{Eq:Def_triple_product}.

\begin{remark}
It is implicit in the formulation of SLSHT that the signal of
interest is band-limited to $L_f < \infty$. As a signal has finite
energy, its spherical harmonic Fourier coefficients are square
summable. Consequently, any signal can be arbitrarily closely
approximated by a band-limited signal by making $L_f$ sufficiently
large. The study of the involved approximation errors on the SLSHT
is outside the scope of this thesis.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
It is important to note here that each SLSHT component of the
form $g(\unit{y}; n)$ is a band-limited function on the sphere with
band-limit $L_h$, that is, $\innerp[\big]{g(\unit{y}; n)}{Y_r^s} = 0$
for all $r>L_h$.
\end{remark}

\subsection{SLSHT Distribution and Matrix Formulation}

\begin{definition}[SLSHT Distribution] The SLSHT distribution $\bv{g}(\unit{x})$ of a signal
$f\in\lsph$ is an indexed vector of all SLSHT components of the form
$g(\unit{y}; n)$ as defined in~(\ref{Eq:stft_spatial1}) for $n=0,
1,\cdots, N_g$, i.e.,
%
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:stft_matrix_def}
    \bv{g}(\unit{y})\dfn \parn[\big]{g(\unit{y};0), \, g(\unit{y};1),\, g(\unit{y};2),
        \, \cdots, \, g(\unit{y};N_g)}',
\end{equation}
where $N_g = L_g^2+2L_g$ and $L_g = L_f + L_h$.
%
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
The SLSHT distribution is a generalization of the transform
in~\cite{Simons:1997} and provides the representation of a signal in the joint spatio-spectral domain.
\end{remark}

Using the preceding formulation, the SLSHT distribution
$\bv{g}(\unit{y})$ in~\eqref{Eq:stft_matrix_def} can be written in
matrix form as
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:stft_matrix}
    \bv{g}(\unit{y}) = \bv{\Psi}(\unit{y}) \bv{f},
\end{equation}
where $\bv{f} = \parn[\big]{\mathcal{F}f}(\unit{x})$ and $\bv{\Psi}$
is the transformation operator matrix of size $(N_g+1)\times
(N_f+1)$, which transforms the given signal in spectral domain to the
spatio-spectral domain and is given by
%
\begin{equation}\label{Eq:psi_matrix}
\bv{\Psi}(\unit{y}) = \left[ {\begin{array}{cccc}
  \psi_{0,0}(\unit{y})& \psi_{0,1}(\unit{y})& \cdots & \psi_{0,N_f}(\unit{y})  \\
  \psi_{1,0}(\unit{y})& \psi_{1,1}(\unit{y})& \cdots & \psi_{1,N_f}(\unit{y})  \\
 \vdots &\vdots &&\vdots  \\[-2mm]
 \psi_{N_g,0}(\unit{y})&\ \psi_{N_g,1}(\unit{y})& \cdots& \psi_{N_g,N_f}(\unit{y})  \\
 \end{array} } \right]
\end{equation}
%
with entries
%
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:kernel_element}
    \psi_{n,u}(\unit{y}) = \sum_{r=0}^{N_h} \shc{h}{r}{}(\unit{y})\,T(u;r;n).
\end{equation}


\begin{remark}
The matrix form in~(\ref{Eq:stft_matrix}) transforms the spectral
response of the signal $\bv{f}$ to the joint spatio-spectral domain.
The size of the transformation matrix is dependent on the spectral
bandwidth of the input signal $f$ and the window function $h$. The
value of matrix elements is dependent on the applied rotation
$\unit{y}$ and the window function $h$, whose choice will be
discussed in Section~\ref{ch4:sec:window}.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Inversion of Signal from its SLSHT distribution}
Recovery of the spectral components of the signal from its localized
transform was first shown in~\cite{Simons:1997}. For the sake of
completeness, based on our matrix formulation, and explicit
expression of the transform in terms of rotated window function, we
provide an alternative formulation. We present the result in the
following theorem.

%
\begin{theorem}[Inversion of Signal from SLSHT Distribution]
%\mathbf{(Inversion of Signal from SLSHT Distribution)}
\label{thm:inversion} If $\bv{g}(\unit{y})$ represents the SLSHT
distribution of the signal $f$ using an azimuthally symmetric window
function $h$, where the distribution is of the
form~(\ref{Eq:stft_matrix_def}), then the spectral domain response
$\bv{f}$ of $f$ can be recovered from $\bv{g}(\unit{y})$ up to a
multiplicative factor as the spherical harmonics marginal
$\unit{f}$, which is obtained by integrating the SLSHT distribution
over the spatial domain as
%
\begin{align}\label{Eq:invthm}
\unit{f}  =   \intsph \bv{g}(\unit{y}) \,ds(\unit{y})
 =  \sqrt{4\pi} \, \shc{h}{0}{0} \times \big(\,\shc{f}{0}{},\, \shc{f}{1}{},\, \cdots,\, \shc{f}{N_f}{},\, 0,\, \cdots,\,
 0\,\big)',
\end{align}
%
where $\unit{f}$ denotes the spherical harmonics marginal and is a
vector of length $N_g+1$ where only the first $N_f+1$ elements are
non-zero.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Integrating~(\ref{Eq:stft_matrix}) over the spatial domain gives
%
\begin{align}\label{Eq:invstart}
\intsph\bv{g}(\unit{y})\,ds(\unit{y}) =
\big(\intsph\bv{\Psi}(\unit{y}) \,ds(\unit{y})\big)\,\bv{f}.
\end{align}
%
The integral of kernel matrix $\bv{\Psi}$ is obtained by integrating
each matrix element $\psi_{n,u}(\unit{y})$
in~(\ref{Eq:kernel_element}), that is,
%
\begin{align}\label{Eq:kernel_integral}
\psi_{n,u}(\unit{y})\,ds(\unit{y}) = \sum_{r=0}^{N_h} T(u;r;n)
\intsph \shc{h}{r}{}(\unit{y})\,ds(\unit{y})
\end{align}
%
Now, using the definition of $\shc{h}{r}{}(\unit{y})$ in
\eqref{Eq:window_r} with mapping $(p,q)\leftrightarrow r$, we obtain
%
\begin{align}\label{eq:result1}
\shc{h}{r}{}(\unit{y}) &= \sqrt{\frac{4\pi}{2p+1}} \shc{h}{p}{0}
\intsph \conj{Y_p^q(\unit{y})} ds(\unit{y}) \nonumber \\
&= \frac{4\pi}{\sqrt2{p+1}} \shc{h}{p}{0} \delta_{p,0} \delta_{q,0}
\nonumber \\ &= 4\pi\, \shc{h}{0}{0} \delta_{r,0}.
\end{align}

%
\noindent Using~(\ref{eq:result1}), all the summation terms
in~(\ref{Eq:kernel_integral}) become zero except for $r=0$. From the
orthonormal property of spherical harmonics, $ T(0;r;n) =
\delta_{r,n}/\sqrt{4 \pi}$. Incorporating these results
in~(\ref{Eq:kernel_integral}), we get
%
\begin{align}\label{Eq:kernel_int_element}
\intsph\psi_{n,u}(\unit{y})\,ds(\unit{y}) = \sqrt{4\pi}
\shc{h}{0}{0}\, \delta_{n,u}.
\end{align}
Substituting~(\ref{Eq:kernel_int_element}) in integrating the
elements of $\bv{\Psi}(\unit{x})$ in~(\ref{Eq:invstart}), we
obtain~(\ref{Eq:invthm}).
\end{proof}
%

% \setcounter{remark}{0}

\begin{remark}
From Theorem~\ref{thm:inversion}, we can see that we
only need to know the DC-component of the window function in order
to recover the signal exactly from its SLSHT distribution.
\end{remark}


\section{Complementary
Distribution}\label{sec:inversion_complementary}

In this section, we present the distribution transform operation
that metamorphoses the proposed SLSHT distribution in
\eqref{Eq:stft_matrix_def} into a new type of distribution which we
call its complementary distribution. We present a method to transform
the SLSHT distribution into the complementary distribution using the
definition inspired by the characteristic function in
\eqref{Eq:Ch_tf_def} in time-frequency analysis. As our proposed
SLSHT distribution in~\eqref{Eq:stft_matrix_def} is not quadratic in
nature, we use the proposed SLSHT distribution itself instead of its
squared magnitude. We will show that the complementary distribution
exhibits some desired properties as it reveals information about
both the signal and window function.  Here, we present the
mathematical definition of complementary distribution and formulate
a relation to express the complementary distribution in terms of the
signal and the window function. We also develop a matrix formulation
for the complementary distribution.
%%%%%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Complementary Distribution Transformation}
In analogy with \eqref{Eq:Ch_tf_def}, the sought distribution
transform transforms the spatial domain component to a corresponding
spectral domain component and the spectral domain component to a spatial
domain component.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%begin definition%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{definition}[Spatio-spectral Complementary Distribution]
We define the spatio-spectral complementary distribution
$\bv{\kappa}(\unit{x})$ as:
%
\begin{align}\label{Eq:Ch_def}
\bv{\kappa}(\unit{x}) = \big(\,\kappa(0, {\unit{x}}), \, \kappa(1,
{\unit{x}}), \, \kappa(2, {\unit{x}}), \, \cdots, \, \kappa(N_h,
{\unit{x}})\,\big)',
\end{align}
%
where each element $\kappa(c, {\unit{x}})$ of the complementary
distribution is related to the components of SLSHT distribution
$\bv{g}(\unit{x})$ in \eqref{Eq:stft_matrix_def} by
%
\begin{align}\label{Eq:Ch_element_def}
 \kappa(c, {\unit{x}})
\triangleq \sum_{n=0}^{N_g} Y_n({\unit{x}}) \intsph
g(\unit{y},n)\overline{Y_c(\unit{y})}\,ds(\unit{y}).
\end{align}
\end{definition}
%%%%%%%end definition%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{remark}
By comparing \eqref{Eq:Ch_element_def} with \eqref{Eq:f_expansion},
we note that $\kappa(c, {\unit{x}})$ is a band-limited function on
the sphere with band-limit $L_g = L_f+L_h$.
\end{remark}

Using the expansion of $g(\unit{y},n)$ in \eqref{Eq:stft_spectral}
and matrix formulation in \eqref{Eq:stft_matrix}, the complementary
distribution can be expressed in matrix form as

\begin{align}\label{Eq:Ch_matrix_form}
\mathbf{\kappa}(\unit{x}) = \mathbf{\Upsilon}(\unit{x})\bv{f},
\end{align}
%
where $\mathbf{\Upsilon}(\unit{x})$ is a matrix of size
$(N_h+1)\times(N_f+1)$ that transforms the signal into its
complementary distribution and the entries of the matrix
$\mathbf{\Upsilon}(\unit{x})$ are given by
%
\begin{align}\label{Eq:Ch_kernel_element}
{\Upsilon_{u,c}}(\unit{x}) = (-1)^b \sqrt{\frac{4\pi}{2a+1}}
\shc{h}{a}{0} \sum_{n=0}^{N_g} Y_n(\unit{x})\,T(s,t;a,-b;\ell,m)
\end{align}
with mappings $(r,s)\leftrightarrow u$, $(a,b)\leftrightarrow c$ and
$(\ell,m)\leftrightarrow n$. The matrix formulation in
\eqref{Eq:Ch_matrix_form} transforms the signal directly into its
complementary distribution and $\mathbf{\Upsilon}(\unit{x})$ acts as
the transformation matrix for this distribution transform operation.

\subsection{Spherical Harmonics Marginal of Complementary Distribution}

We present the spherical harmonics marginal of complementary
distribution in the form of the following Theorem.

\begin{theorem}[Spherical Harmonics Marginal of Complementary
Distribution]
%\mathbf{(Spherical Harmonics Marginal of Complementary
%Distribution)}
\label{thm:cmpthm} If $\mathbf{\kappa}$ represents the complementary
distribution of the signal $f$ as defined in \eqref{Eq:Ch_def} using
azimuthally symmetric window function $h$, then the spherical
harmonics marginal of $\mathbf{\kappa}$ is obtained by integrating
the distribution over the spatial domain and is given by
%
\begin{align}\label{Eq:window_inversion}
\intsph \mathbf{\kappa}(\unit{x}) \, ds(\unit{x}) &= \big(\,[hf]_0,
\, [hf]_1, \, \cdots, \, [hf]_{N_h})',
\end{align}
%
where
\begin{align}\label{Eq:window_inversion_element}
[hf]_c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi(2a+1)}} \; \shc{h}{a}{0} \;
\shc{f}{a}{b}
\end{align}
with $(a,b)\leftrightarrow c$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We obtain the spherical harmonics marginal of the distribution
$\mathbf{\kappa}$ by integrating \eqref{Eq:Ch_matrix_form} over
the spatial domain
%
\begin{align}\label{Eq:Ch_iversion_start}
\intsph\mathbf{\kappa}(\unit{x}) \, d\unit{x} =
\big(\intsph\mathbf{\Upsilon}(\unit{x}) \, ds(\unit{x}) \big)\bv{f}.
\end{align}
%
The integral of kernel matrix $\mathbf{\Upsilon}(\unit{x}) $ is
obtained by integrating each matrix element. Using the definition of
$\Upsilon_{u,c}(\unit{x})$ in~(\ref{Eq:Ch_kernel_element}), we can
write
%
\begin{align}\label{Eq:Ch_kernel_integral}
\intsph {\Upsilon_{u,c}}(\unit{x}) \, ds(\unit{x}) = (-1)^b
\sqrt{\frac{4\pi}{2a+1}} \shc{h}{a}{0} \sum_{n=0}^{N_g}
 T(s,t;a,-b;\ell,m)\, \intsph Y_n(\unit{x}) ds(\unit{x}).
\end{align}
%
As a consequence of the integration over the
whole sphere, all the summation terms
in~(\ref{Eq:Ch_kernel_integral}) become zero except for $n=0$, which
implies $\ell=0$ and $m=0$. In addition, using the orthonormal
property of spherical harmonics and the definition of the spherical
harmonics triple product in \eqref{Ch4:Eq:triple_prod_abc}, we have
%
\begin{align}
T(s,t;a,-b;0,0) = \frac{(-1)^{b} \delta_{s,a} \delta_{t,b}}{\sqrt{4
\pi}},
\end{align}
%
with $(a,b)\leftrightarrow c$ and $(r,s)\leftrightarrow t$.
Incorporating these results in~(\ref{Eq:Ch_kernel_integral}), we get
%
\begin{align}\label{Eq:Ch_kernel_int_element}
\intsph {\Upsilon_{u,c}}(\unit{x}) \, ds(\unit{x})
 = \frac{ \shc{h}{a}{0}}{\sqrt{4\pi(2a+1)}}  \delta_{s,a}
 \delta_{t,b}.
\end{align}
%
Upon substituting~(\ref{Eq:Ch_kernel_int_element}) for
matrix elements of $\mathbf{\Upsilon}$ in~(\ref{Eq:Ch_iversion_start}),
we obtain the result~(\ref{Eq:window_inversion}) stated in
Theorem~\ref{thm:cmpthm}.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
The result in Theorem~\ref{thm:cmpthm} states that
the spherical harmonics marginal of complementary distribution gives
the element-wise product of spherical harmonic coefficients of the
signal $f$ and window function $h$ with a scaling factor that
depends upon the degree of the spherical harmonic coefficients.
Using this property of complementary
distribution~\eqref{Eq:window_inversion}, we can recover the window
function completely from its distribution assuming we obtain the
signal first from its SLSHT distribution $\bv{g}(\unit{x})$. In
conclusion, all we need is the DC-component of the window function
$\shc{h}{0}{0}$ to recover both the signal and window function from
its proposed SLSHT distribution or complementary distribution. Note
that the window function cannot be directly recovered from the SLSHT
distribution.

\section{Optimal Spatio-spectral Concentration of Window Function}\label{ch4:sec:window}

The SLSHT distribution does not depend solely on the signal because
the distribution entangles the signal and the window. The
effectiveness of SLSHT distribution to reveal the information about the localized spectral contents of a signal in the spatio-spectral domain depends on the chosen window
function. If we require higher resolution in one domain, the
window should be narrower in that domain. From the uncertainty
principle on the unit sphere, a signal cannot be locally
concentrated in both the spatial and spectral
domains~\cite{Narcowich:1996}. If a window is chosen to obtain the
desired resolution in one domain, it is said to be an optimal window
if it is also optimally localized in the other
domain~\cite{Cohen:1989}.

We study the window functions jointly in both spatial and spectral
domains using the definition of uncertainty principle on the unit
sphere. The following inequality, referred as the uncertainty principle,
holds for unit energy azimuthally symmetric functions defined on the
unit sphere~\cite{Narcowich:1996,Freeden:1999}
%
\begin{align}\label{Eq:uncertain_prod1}
\frac{\sigma_{\textrm{S}}}{\sqrt{1-\sigma_{\textrm{S}}^2}}\cdot
\sigma_{\textrm{L}} \geq 1,
\end{align}

\noindent where $\sigma_{\textrm{S}}$ and $\sigma_{\textrm{L}}$
denote the variance of the window function in the spatial domain and
spectral domain respectively and are defined
as~\cite{Wieczorek:2005,Narcowich:1996}
%
\begin{align}\label{Eq:sigmaz}
\sigma_{\textrm{S}}^2 = 1 - \Big(\pi \int_0^{\pi} \sin (2\theta)\,
\big|h(\theta)\big|^2\,d\theta \,\Big)^2, \quad
\sigma_{\textrm{L}}^2 = \sum_{\ell=0}^\infty \ell (\ell+1)
|\shc{h}{\ell}{0}|^2.
\end{align}
%
\noindent Note that a unit energy window function is assumed in
\eqref{Eq:sigmaz}, which ensures that $0 \leq \sigma_{\textrm{S}}
\leq 1$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this work, we consider and compare the following unit energy
normalized azimuthally symmetric window functions: rectangular
window, triangular window, cosine window, Hamming window, Hanning
window, the window of Simons~\textit{et al.}~\cite{Simons:1997},
Gaussian window and the \emph{eigenfunction window}, all of which
are parameterized by $\theta_c$ denoting the window truncation
width. The first five windows are defined in \cite{Harris:1978}. The
window in~\cite{Simons:1997} is obtained by truncating the
rectangular window in the spectral domain within the main spectral
lobe. The Gaussian window is a unit energy normalized function that
decays exponentially with the square of the colatitude and its
variance is chosen such that $99\%$ of the energy lies within the
truncation width. The eigenfunction window $h(\unit{x})$ arises as a
solution of a Slepian concentration problem on the
sphere~\cite{Simons:2006}. To maximize the spatial concentration of
a band-limited signal $h(\unit{x})$ with maximum spherical harmonic
degree $L_h$, equivalently represented by the column vector $\bv{h}^0$
containing the entries $\shc{h}{\ell}{0}$ for $0\leq\ell\leq L_h$,
within a polar cap region $R$ characterized by truncation width
$\theta_c$, one needs to maximize the spatial concentration
ratio~\cite{Wieczorek:2005,Simons:2006}
%
\begin{align}\label{eq:eig_value}
\lambda =\frac{\int_R |h(\unit{x})|^2\,d\unit{x} }{\intsph
|h(\unit{x})|^2\,d\unit{x}}.
\end{align}
The solution that maximizes \eqref{eq:eig_value} gives rise to the
standard eigenvalue problem $\mathbf{D}\bv{h}^0=\lambda\bv{h}^0$,
which can be solved numerically. As we are considering an azimuthally
symmetric region $R$, $\bv{h}^0 =
[\shc{h}{0}{0},\,\shc{h}{1}{0},\,\hdots,\,\shc{h}{L_h}{0}]$ denotes
the spectral response of $h(\unit{y})$ and $\mathbf{D}$ is the
($L_h+1) \times (L_h+1$) real and symmetric matrix where the entries
are given by $D_{{\ell}{\ell}'}
=\int_RY_{\ell}^0(\unit{x})Y_{{\ell}'}^{0}(\unit{x})\,d\unit{x}$. We
use the band-limited eigenfunction as window function, the one corresponding to the largest eigenvalue and having minimum possible bandwidth $L_h$ is related
to truncation width $\theta_c$ as $L_h = ({2\pi}/{\theta_c})
-1$~\cite{Simons:2006}.

\figref{ch4:fig: one} plots the (a) variance $\sigma_{\textrm{S}}$
in spatial domain, (b) variance $\sigma_{\textrm{L}}$ in spectral
domain and (c) uncertainty product in~\eqref{Eq:uncertain_prod1} for
different types of azimuthally symmetric window functions and
different values of truncation width $\pi/32\leq \theta_c\leq
\pi/4$. \figref{ch4:fig: one}(a) and \figref{ch4:fig: one}(b) show
that generally the variance in spatial domain increases with
truncation width and the variance in spectral domain decreases with
the truncation width. The rectangular window has the poorest
localization because the discontinuity at truncation points
increases its variance in the spectral domain. As expected, the
window in~\cite{Simons:1997} performs very well in the spectral
domain, but poorly in the spatial domain. The figure also shows
that the Gaussian window and the eigenfunction window exhibit better
localization behavior. Comparatively, these two windows have the
lowest variances in both domains. Note that the smaller value for
variance indicates better localization. \figref{ch4:fig: one}(c)
confirms that both the eigenfunction window and the Gaussian window
nearly attain the lower bound of $1$ for the uncertainty product of
\eqref{Eq:uncertain_prod1}. The rectangular window has the largest
uncertainty product as expected. The product for other windows,
including the window in~\cite{Simons:1997}, lie between these two
extremes.

The optimal truncation width depends on the required resolution in
both the spatial and spectral domains. As indicated in the variance
plot in \figref{ch4:fig: one}, the spatial variance
$\sigma_{\textrm{S}}$ of the eigenfunction window is very close to that
of the Gaussian window. But the spectral variance $\sigma_{\textrm{L}}$
of the eigenfunction window is lower than that of the Gaussian window,
especially at lower truncation widths. The Gaussian window and
eigenfunction window are plotted for truncation width $\theta_c =
\pi/6$ in both spatial and spectral domains in
\figref{fig:win_gauss_eig}. Both windows are normalized to unit
energy and chosen such that $99\%$ of energy lies within the
truncation width. It is observed that the eigenfunction window has
smaller bandwidth and its energy is more uniformly distributed
relative to Gaussian window in the spatial domain. Thus, the eigenfunction window can be a
good choice for window function in the SLSHT distribution.

It must be noted that compared to space-scale techniques, the
spectral-space resolution of the SLSHT is fixed for all spectral
components and spatial positions. Incorporating multi-resolution
capability in SLSHT is possible, but would require using different
bandwidth window functions for different SLSHT distribution
components, consideration of which is beyond the scope of this
correspondence. Finally, we remark that with appropriate
modifications it is possible to incorporate non-azimuthally
symmetric windows into our formulation.

\section{Simulation Results}\label{ch4:sec:results}

In this section, we demonstrate the spatially localized spherical
harmonics transform and our proposed window to study the signals in
joint spatio-spectral domain. We consider a Mars topographic map~(height above geoid) as a signal on the
sphere that has higher degree harmonic components in a localized
mountainous spatial region. We study the high resolution Mars
topographic map~(size = $512\times512$) using SLSHT and illustrate
that the SLSHT distribution reveals localized spectral contributions
of spherical harmonics in the spatial domain. In the simulation
results, we have implemented the method outlined in
\cite{Driscoll:1994} to calculate the spherical harmonic components
and triple product in \texttt{MATLAB}. We use equiangular sampling
with $N \times N$ samples on the sphere as $\theta_n = \pi n /N$,
$\phi_n = 2 \pi n/N$ for $n=0,1,\hdots,N-1$. Note that exact
quadrature can be performed using this tessellation with errors on
the order of numerical precision. We use the azimuthally symmetric
band-limited Slepian eigenfunction window to obtain localization
in spatial domain. For SLSHT distribution computation using a window
with bandwidth $L_h$, we use a very high resolution $N=256 \gg 2L_h$
to obtain smooth plots. Finally, for inverse spherical harmonic
transform of a function with maximum spherical harmonics degree
$L_f$, we use minimum resolution $N=2L_f$~\cite{Driscoll:1994} for
exact quadrature.

\figref{fig:mars_fig_1} shows the Mars topographic map $f(\unit{x})$
in the spatial domain. The Mars topographic map $f(\unit{x})$ is
obtained in the spatial domain using its spherical harmonics
topographic model up to degree of $128$. There are volcanoes leading
to high frequency content in the signal which are localized in the
vicinity of $\theta = \pi/2$ and $\phi = -\pi/3$. We use the unit
energy normalized Mars signal with DC-component eliminated. If
$\shc{f}{\ell}{m}$ denotes the spherical harmonic coefficients for
the Mars signal $f(\unit{x})$, we define the energy per degree
$E_{\ell}$ as
\begin{align}\label{energy_per_deg}
E_{\ell} &= \sum _{m=-{\ell}}^{\ell}|\shc{f}{\ell}{m}|^2.
\end{align}

\figref{fig:mars_fig_2}(a) shows the energy per degree $E_{\ell}$ in
the spectrum of Mars, which indicates that $90\%$ of the energy is
contributed by the spherical harmonics with degree less than $10$.
The higher degree spherical harmonics contribute towards high
frequency regions in a signal and contain very little energy. The higher degree spherical harmonic coefficients do not
clearly provide information about the region of their contributions in the
signal $f(\unit{x})$. We determine all SLSHT components of the form
$g(\unit{x}, c)$ for $1\leq c \leq 960$ or $g(\unit{x},\ell,m)$ for
$1 \leq \ell \leq 30$ and all orders $|m|\leq \ell$ using an
eigenfunction window with truncation width $\theta_c = \pi/8$. We
calculate the energy contribution by spherical harmonics in a region
around volcanoes. We expect that higher spherical harmonics would
have significant energy concentrated around the volcanoes. We
define the energy ratio per degree $E'_{\ell}$ as a measure of
energy contribution by all order spherical harmonics for a
particular degree in the localized region as
%
\begin{align}\label{eqn:enrgyrat}
E'_{\ell} &= \sum_{m=-\ell} ^{\ell} \frac {\int_{R}
|g(\unit{x},\ell,m)|^2\,d\unit{x}}  {\intsph
|g(\unit{x},\ell,m)|^2\,d\unit{x}},

contribution of higher order spherical harmonics is mainly around
the region where volcanoes are located. Note that it is also
possible to resolve topographic features such as volcanoes using
wavelets, as demonstrated in~\cite{Audet:2011}. However, the SLSHT
distribution provides interpretation about the spectral
contributions of a particular spherical harmonic in a localized
region in the spatial domain, which is not explicitly available using
wavelets.

\section{Concentration Uncertainty Principle}\label{sec:principle}
In the previous section, we analyzed different window functions
from the perspective of the classic uncertainty principle that relates
the variances of the signal in the spatial and spectral
domains~\cite{Narcowich:1996,Freeden:1999,Wieczorek:2005}. A more
general notion of uncertainty, herein referred to as a concentration
uncertainty principle, was provided by Donoho and Stark. It holds that a
function and its Fourier transform cannot be simultaneously  concentrated on
any set of small measure~\cite{Donoho:1989}. The authors
in~\cite{Donoho:1989} defined two criteria for measuring
concentrations as the integral of an absolute value of the signal ($L_1$-norm) and
as the signal energy ($L_2$-norm). We note that concentration
uncertainty principles have also been extensively applied in
problems of signal reconstruction and recovery~\cite{Donoho:1989},
signal extrapolation~\cite{Candes:2006} and compressive
sampling~\cite{Goyal:2008}.

In this section, we formulate concentration uncertainty
principles for signals on the sphere where the concentration is
measured using the $L_1$-norm and $L_2$-norm of a signal
respectively. More precisely, if the signal $f(\unit{x})$ on the
sphere is concentrated on some spatial region $R\subset \sphh$ and
also concentrated on some spectral region $N = [N_1,N_2]$ which
denotes the spherical harmonic coefficients $\shc{f}{\ell}{m}$ with
$N_1 \leq \ell \leq N_2$ and $-\ell \leq m \leq \ell$, we develop
the principles which relate the concentration measures and
concentration regions in both spatial and spectral domains. Note
that the region $R$ does not need to be connected, whereas for the
sake of simplicity, we consider the connected interval $N$ in
spectral domain but this can also be generalized for
non-connected intervals. Here connected interval means that $N=[N_1,N_2]$ contains all degrees between $N_1$ and $N_2$. We first define the selection operators in
both spatial and spectral domains which select the part of a signal
in a selected spatial or spectral region~\cite{Rod_icspcs:2008}.
Then we state and prove the uncertainty principles. We first define
$L_p$ norm of a signal defined on the sphere and the $L_p$ norm of
an operator on $\lsph$. Later, we formulate selection operators in
the spatial and spectral domain and then we provide the
concentration uncertainty principles.

\subsection{$L_p$ norm of Signal and Operator}
For a signal $f\in \lsph$, its $L_p$-norm is defined
as~\cite{Schechter:2002}
\begin{align}\label{Eq:p_norm_signal_def}
\|f\|_p = \big(\intsph |f(\unit{x})|^p\, ds(\unit{x})\big)^{1/p}.
\end{align}
%
Define an operator $\mathcal{K}$ for signals on the sphere using
general Fredholm integral equation~\cite{kennedy:book}
\begin{align}\label{Eq:gen_operator_def}
(\mathcal{K}f)(\unit{x})\,=\,\intsph K(\unit{x},
\unit{y})\,f(\unit{y})ds(\unit{y}),
\end{align}
where $K(\unit{x}, \unit{y})$ is the kernel for an operator
$\mathcal{K}$. Since it is important in the sequel, we define the
$L_p$-norm of an operator $\mathcal{K}$ as
\begin{align}\label{Eq:Lp_norm_operator}
\|\mathcal{K}\|_p = \sup_{f\in
\sphh}\frac{\|\mathcal{K}f\|_p}{\|f\|_p}.
\end{align}
Also, the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of an operator $\mathcal{K}$ with
kernel $K({\unit{x},\unit{y}})$ is given by~\cite{Donoho:1989}
\begin{align}\label{Eq:HS_norm_operator}
\|\mathcal{K}\|_H = \left(\intsph \intsph |K(\unit{x},\unit{y})|^2
ds(\unit{x}) \,ds(\unit{y})\right)^{1/2},
\end{align}
\noindent which is a bound on $\|\mathcal{K}\|_2$. We note that the kernel $K({\unit{x},\unit{y}})$ will always be taken as Hilbert-Schmidt, meaning $\|\mathcal{K}\|_H <\infty$, which is a sufficient condition to make the integral operator compact.



\subsection{Selection Operators on the Sphere}

\begin{definition}[Spatial Selection Operator] \emph{Define the spatial selection
operator $\mathcal{K}_R$ which selects the function in a region $R$
with kernel $K_R(\unit{x}, \unit{y})$ as
\begin{align}\label{Eq:kernel_spatial_def}
K_R(\unit{x}, \unit{y}) \,\triangleq \, I_R(\unit{x})
\delta(\unit{x}, \unit{y}),
\end{align}
where $I_R(\unit{x})=1$ for $\unit{x}\in R\subset \sphh$ and
$I_R(\unit{x})=0$ for $\unit{x}\in \sphh \backslash R$ is an
indicator function of the region $R$ and $\delta(\unit{x},
\unit{y})$ denotes the Dirac delta function on the sphere given in
\eqref{Eq:delta_def_expansion} .}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Spectral Selection Operator] \emph{Define the spectral selection
operator $\mathcal{K}_N$ with $N = [N_1,N_2]$, which selects the
contribution of spherical harmonics in spectral region $N$ in a
signal and has the kernel $K_N$ as
\begin{align}\label{Eq:kernel_spectral_def}
K_N(\unit{x}, \unit{y}) \,\triangleq \,
\sum_{\ell=N_1}^{N_2}\,\sum_{m=-\ell}^\ell\, Y_\ell^m(\unit{x})\,
\overline{Y_\ell^m(\unit{y})}.
\end{align}}
\end{definition}
We note that both the spatial and spectral selection operators are
idempotent and self-adjoint. That is, they are projection
operators.

\subsection{The $L_1$-norm Uncertainty Principle}
We first present the $L_1$-norm uncertainty principle which relates
the concentration of signal in spatial and spectral domains to the
measure of spatial and spectral regions, where the concentration is
determined using the $L_1$-norm of a signal. We say that $f$ is
$\epsilon_R$ concentrated in the spatial domain and $\epsilon_N$
concentrated in the spectral domain if $\|f-\mathcal{K}_Rf\|_1 \leq
\epsilon_R$ and $\|f-\mathcal{K}_Nf\|_1 \leq \epsilon_N$
respectively.
%
\begin{theorem}[$L_1$-norm Uncertainty Principle]
\emph{If the unit $L_1$-norm signal $f$ is $\epsilon_R$ concentrated
in the region $R\subset\sphh$ and $\epsilon_N$ concentrated in the
spectral region $N=[N_1,N_2]$, then
\begin{align}\label{Eq:thm1_statement}
\frac{A}{4\pi}\,{\Big((N_2+1)^2 -N_1^2}\Big) \,\geq\,
\frac{1-\epsilon_R - \epsilon_N}{1+\epsilon_N},
\end{align}
where $A = \intsph I_R(\unit{x})ds(\unit{x})$ denotes the area of
the region $R$. }\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Since, the signal $f$ is unit-norm, we have
\begin{align}\label{Eq:proof_thm1_1}
\|f\|_1 = \intsph|f(\unit{x})| ds(\unit{x}) = 1
\end{align}
and using the given $\|f-\mathcal{K}_Rf\|_1 \leq \epsilon_R$ and
$\|f-\mathcal{K}_Nf\|_1 \leq \epsilon_N$ and the fact that
$\|f-\mathcal{K}_Rf\|_1\geq \|f\|_1-\|\mathcal{K}_Rf\|_1$, we obtain
\begin{align}\label{Eq:proof_thm1_2}
\|\mathcal{K}_Rf\|_1 + \epsilon_R \geq 1\,,\quad \|\mathcal{K}_Nf\|
+ \epsilon_N \geq 1.
\end{align}
Define a composite operator $\mathcal{K}_{RN} =
\mathcal{K}_{R}\mathcal{K}_{N}$. From \eqref{Eq:proof_thm1_1} and
\eqref{Eq:proof_thm1_2}, we obtain the $L_1$-norm of this composite
operator as
\begin{align}\label{Eq:proof_thm1_3}
\|\mathcal{K}_{RN}\|_1 \geq \|\mathcal{K}_{RN}f\|_1 \geq 1
-\epsilon_R-\epsilon_N.
\end{align}
%
\noindent Since, the operator $\mathcal{K}_N$ is idempotent, using
the spherical harmonic expansion of $f$, we can write
%
\begin{align}\label{Eq:proof_thm1_4}
(\mathcal{K}_Nf)(\unit{x}) &=
\sum_{\ell=N_1}^{N_2}\,\sum_{m=-\ell}^\ell\,\intsph
Y_\ell^m(\unit{x})\, \overline{Y_\ell^m(\unit{y})}
(\mathcal{K}_Nf)(\unit{y})\,ds(\unit{y}).
\end{align}

\noindent Using the spherical harmonics addition theorem in
\eqref{Eq:addition_theorem}, we can obtain from
\eqref{Eq:proof_thm1_4} that
%
\begin{align}\label{Eq:proof_thm1_44}
|(\mathcal{K}_Nf)(\unit{x})| &=
\sum_{\ell=N_1}^{N_2}\frac{2\ell+1}{4\pi}\intsph |P_\ell^0(\unit{x}
\cdot \unit{y})| ds(\unit{y})
\end{align}

\noindent and we have $\sup\|P_\ell^0(\unit{x} \cdot \unit{y})\|_1 =
1$ and $\|(\mathcal{K}_Nf)\|_\infty =
\max|(\mathcal{K}_Nf)(\unit{x})| $ for $\unit{x}\in\sphh$, which
implies
\begin{align}\label{Eq:proof_thm1_5}
\|(\mathcal{K}_Nf)\|_\infty \, \leq\, \frac{1}{4\pi}\Big((N_2+1)^2
-N_1^2\Big) \|(\mathcal{K}_Nf)\|_1.
\end{align}
For the composite operator $\mathcal{K}_{RN}$, we have
\begin{align}\label{Eq:proof_thm1_6}
\|\mathcal{K}_{RN}f\|_1 =
\int_{R}|(\mathcal{K}_Nf)(\unit{x})|ds(\unit{x}) \leq
\|\mathcal{K}_Nf\|_\infty A,
\end{align}
where $A$ is the area of the region $R$. Using
\eqref{Eq:proof_thm1_6} and \eqref{Eq:proof_thm1_5}, we obtain
\begin{align}\label{Eq:proof_thm1_7}
\|\mathcal{K}_{RN}f\|_1\, \leq\, \frac{A}{4\pi}\,\Big((N_2+1)^2
-N_1^2\Big) \|(\mathcal{K}_Nf)\|_1.
\end{align}
Combining \eqref{Eq:proof_thm1_1}, \eqref{Eq:proof_thm1_2} and
\eqref{Eq:proof_thm1_3} with \eqref{Eq:proof_thm1_7} gives the
stated result.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
\emph{The factor $\frac{A}{4\pi}\,{\Big((N_2+1)^2 -N_1^2}\Big)$ on
the left hand side of \eqref{Eq:thm1_statement} can be defined as a
generalized space-bandwidth product, with the term $A/4\pi$ being a
measure of the spatial region ${R}$ and the term $(N_2+1)^2 -N_1^2$
being a measure of the spectral region $N=[N_1,N_2]$. For $N_1=0$, this
space-bandwidth product is referred to as an equivalent of the
Shannon number in~\cite{Simons:2006} for signals defined on the
sphere.}

\subsection{The $L_2$-norm Uncertainty Principle}
Next, we present the uncertainty principle for the case in which the
concentration is measured using $L_2$-norm, which is a measure of
energy of the signal and makes this principle more appealing and
practical.
%
\begin{theorem}[$L_2$-norm Uncertainty Principle]
\emph{If the unit $L_2$-norm signal $f$ is $\epsilon_R$ concentrated
in the region $R\subset\sphh$ such that $\|f-\mathcal{K}_Rf\|_2 \leq
\epsilon_R$ and $\epsilon_N$ concentrated in the spectral region
$N=[N_1,N_2]$ such that $\|f-\mathcal{K}_Nf\|_2 \leq \epsilon_N$,
then
\begin{align}\label{Eq:thm2_statement}
\frac{A}{4\pi}\,{\Big((N_2+1)^2 -N_1^2}\Big) \,\geq\, ({1-\epsilon_R
- \epsilon_N})^2,
\end{align}
where $A = \intsph I_R(\unit{x})d\unit{x}$ denotes the area of the
region $R$. }\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
By definition, $\|f\|_2=1$, $\|f-\mathcal{K}_Rf\|_2 \leq \epsilon_R$
and $\|f-\mathcal{K}_Nf\|_2 \leq \epsilon_N$, which implies
\begin{align}\label{Eq:proof_thm2_1}
\|\mathcal{K}_Rf\|_2\geq1-\epsilon_R\,,\quad
\|\mathcal{K}_Nf\|_2\geq1-\epsilon_N.
\end{align}
Define a composite operator $\mathcal{K}_{NR} =
\mathcal{K}_{N}\mathcal{K}_{R}$ composed of spatial selection
operation $\mathcal{R}$ followed by spectral selection
$\mathcal{K}_N$. By substituting \eqref{Eq:kernel_spatial_def} and
\eqref{Eq:kernel_spectral_def} in \eqref{Eq:gen_operator_def} and
using the representation of Dirac delta in
\eqref{Eq:delta_def_expansion}, we obtain the kernel
$K_{NR}(\unit{x}, \unit{y})$ as
\begin{align}\label{Eq:proof_thm2_2}
{K}_{NR}(\unit{x}, \unit{y}) &=
\sum_{\ell=N_1}^{N_2}\,\sum_{m=-\ell}^\ell\, Y_\ell^m(\unit{x})\,
\overline{Y_\ell^m(\unit{y})} I_R(\unit{y}).
\end{align}

\noindent The Hilbert-Schmidt norm of the composite operator
$\mathcal{K}_{NR}$ can be obtained using \eqref{Eq:HS_norm_operator}
along with the spherical harmonics addition theorem in
\eqref{Eq:addition_theorem} and the fact that $P_\ell^0(1)=1$ as
\begin{align}\label{Eq:proof_thm2_3}
\|\mathcal{K}_{NR}\|_H &=
\Bigg(\sum_{\ell=N_1}^{N_2}\frac{2\ell+1}{4\pi} \int_{R}ds(\unit{x})
\nonumber \Bigg)^{1/2}\\ &= \Bigg(\frac{A}{4\pi}\,{\big((N_2+1)^2
-N_1^2}\big)\Bigg)^{1/2}.
\end{align}
Now, the effect of the composite operator on the concentration can
be readily obtained from \eqref{Eq:proof_thm2_1} as
\begin{align}\label{Eq:proof_thm2_4}
\|\mathcal{K}_{NR}\,f\|_2 \geq 1 - \epsilon_R -\epsilon_N.
\end{align}
Using definition of the norm of operator in
\eqref{Eq:Lp_norm_operator},
$\|\mathcal{K}_{NR}\|_2\geq\|\mathcal{K}_{NR}\,f\|_2$ and the fact
that $\|\mathcal{K}_{NR}\|_H\geq\|\mathcal{K}_{NR}\|_2$ and combined
with \eqref{Eq:proof_thm2_3} and \eqref{Eq:proof_thm2_4} gives the
result in \eqref{Eq:thm2_statement}.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
\emph{We can infer from the proof of Theorem~$4.4$ that the
composite operator $\mathcal{K}_{RN} =
\mathcal{K}_{R}\mathcal{K}_{N}$ is an adjoint of the operator
$\mathcal{K}_{NR}$ which implies that the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of
these two composite operators is equal and given by
\eqref{Eq:proof_thm2_3}.}
\end{remark}


\subsection{Sharpness of the Uncertainty Principle Bound}
We provide an analysis of the bound imposed by the $L_2$-norm
uncertainty principle on simultaneous spatial and spectral
signal concentration. We
compare this bound with the largest eigenvalue obtained from the
Slepian concentration problem for azimuthally symmetric signals on
the sphere proposed in
\cite{Albertella:1999,Wieczorek:2005,Simons:2006}. First, we
consider the spatial polar cap regions $R$ characterized by central
angle $\Theta$ with area $A = \int_o^\pi\int_0^\Theta\sin\theta
d\theta d\phi = 2\pi(1-\cos\Theta)$ and the spectral regions
$N=[0,N_2]$. We use $\lambda_c(\Theta,N_2)$ to denote the largest
eigenvalue obtained numerically by solving the concentration problem
on the sphere~\cite{Wieczorek:2005}, which finds the band-limited
signal of maximum spectral degree $N_2$ with maximum energy
concentration in the polar cap region of angle $\Theta$. We obtain
a simplified form of the product on the left hand side in
\eqref{Eq:thm2_statement} for spatial and spectral regions under
consideration as $\lambda_0(\Theta,N_2) = (N_2+1)^2(1-\cos\Theta)/2
$, which serves as an uncertainty bound. Fig~\ref{fig:uncertain1}
shows the comparison of $\lambda_c(\Theta,N_2)$ and
$\lambda_0(\Theta,N_2)$ against $\Theta$ for $N_2 = 10$ and $N_2 =
20$, which suggests that $\lambda_0$ serves as a sharp bound for
the spatial polar cap region $R$ and it gets tighter for smaller
values of $\lambda_0$.

     \caption{Comparison of the uncertainty bound $\lambda_0 = (N_2+1)^2(1-\cos\Theta)/2$ obtained from \eqref{Eq:thm2_statement} and the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_c$ associated with the most concentrated band-limited eigenfunction obtained from Slepian's concentration problem on the sphere~\cite{Wieczorek:2005}. Results are shown as a function of the area $A$ of the spatial polar cap regions with consideration of spectral regions $N=[0,N_2]$ for $N_2 = 10$ and $N_2 = 20$. }%\eqref{Eq:rotation1}}
    \label{fig:uncertain1}
\end{figure}
%%---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the preceding analysis, we considered the connected polar cap
region of central angle $\Theta$. Next, we consider a non-connected region of two
polar caps centered at opposite poles~($\theta=0$ and
$\theta = \pi$) with the central angle of each polar cap being
$\cos^{-1}(1+\cos\Theta)/{2}$. It can be easily shown that the
region of two polar caps have the same area $A=2\pi(1-\cos\Theta)$,
thus the same uncertainty bound holds. But
the tightness of the bound is comparatively reduced as illustrated
by the `non-connected region' curve in Fig~\ref{fig:uncertain1}.
For an example considered here, we note that the bound or the limit imposed by
concentration uncertainty principle is more sharper and tighter for
connected regions and smaller values of space-bandwidth product
respectively.


\section{Summary of Contributions}\label{ch4:sec:conclusions}

In this chapter, we have proposed a transform which we have called
the spatially localized spherical harmonics transform~(SLSHT) for
signals defined on the unit sphere. The proposed technique
transforms signals on the sphere into joint spatio-spectral SLSHT
distribution that represents how the signal spectrum is changing in
the spatial domain. We also presented the complementary distribution,
analogous to characteristic function in the time-frequency analysis.
We formulated the matrix representation of the proposed transforms
and proved that the signal and window can be recovered from the
SLSHT distribution. We used an azimuthally symmetric window to
achieve spatial localization and analyzed the localization trade-off
for a window function in both spatial and spectral domains from the
perspective of the uncertainty principle. In this work, we have also
investigated concentration uncertainty principles for the
signals on the sphere that relate the localization of concentration
of a signal in spatial and spectral domains. The contributions made
in this chapter are as follows.


Addressing Q2 posed in Section~\ref{sec:intro_questions}:

\begin{itemize}
\item  We have
employed a localized spherical harmonic transform, herein referred
as SLSHT, to represent the signal in spatio-spectral domain. In
spirit, the proposed transform is analogous to STFT in
time-frequency analysis.

\item We have provided the matrix representation of the transform,
resulting in spatio-spectral representation which we call SLSHT
distribution. To support our formulation of spatio-spectral
distribution, we have presented the inversion relation to obtain
signal from its SLSHT distribution.

\item Later, we have illustrated with the help of an example that the SLSHT
distribution of a signal reveals the spatially localized
contributions of spherical harmonics, which are not clearly visible in the
global spectrum of the signal.

\end{itemize}

Addressing Q3 posed in Section~\ref{sec:intro_questions}:

\begin{itemize}
\item From the perspective of uncertainty principle, we have studied the
localization trade-off for different window functions in both
spatial and spectral domains and proposed to use the eigenfunction
window, obtained from the Slpeian concentration problem on the
sphere~\cite{Albertella:1999,Wieczorek:2005}, for spatial
localization in obtaining the SLSHT distribution of a signal.

\end{itemize}


Addressing Q4 posed in Section~\ref{sec:intro_questions}:

\begin{itemize}
\item We have derived new uncertainty
principles for the signals on the sphere that relate the
localization of concentration of a signal in spatial and spectral
domains. Considering the concentration as an integral of the absolute value of a
signal over the sphere, the $L_1$-norm uncertainty principle has been derived. We
also derived the more practical $L_2$-norm uncertainty principle
using the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of the composite selection operator
on the sphere.

\end{itemize}
